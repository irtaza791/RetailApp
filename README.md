Retail App

Focus of the app

The main aim of the retail app is to help the small business. Where people have no idea how to manage their stock. The goal of this app is help people keep track of the products in the store and also the products that have been sold.
Features that are used
The QR code scanner to scan the barcode of any type of the products.
I will be implementing database to store the products data e.g. barcode, name, quantity.
Log in system which will be only given to people who want to use the service. Basically, this app will be subscription based only.
The Sensors will be location , camera, gyro sensors.
